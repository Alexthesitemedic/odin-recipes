    <h4>Bandeja Paisa is regarded as the national dish of Colombia.</h4>
    <p>Back in the day, in the Andean state of Antioquia, peasant field workers would start their day with Bandeja Paisa. It was a means of providing them a full day's worth of energy and nourishment to keep them working throughout the day. </p>
    <p>This hearty dish includes red beans, white rice, chicharrón, carne en polvo, chorizo, fried egg, ripe plantain, avocado and arepa. When you ask a Colombian what dish to try first in Colombia, Bandeja Paisa is invariably the answer!</p>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Chicharrones: Place pork belly on a rimmed baking sheet. Stir together salt, sugar and cumin; rub evenly on pork. Wrap pork in plastic wrap, and chill 6 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425°F. Unwrap pork, and place, fat side up, on a lightly greased wire rack. Place rack in a rimmed baking sheet, and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce oven temperature to 250°F, and cook until pork is tender when pierced with a fork, about 1 hour and 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Cool to room temperature, about 45 minutes. Wrap pork in plastic wrap, and chill until firm, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Cut pork into 4 strips. Cut 3/4-inch deep slits crosswise in pork at 1-inch intervals. Heat a large skillet over medium. Cook pork until golden brown and crispy, about 4 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Hogao: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium. Add onions, bell pepper, and achiote paste; cook, stirring occasionally, until tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, garlic, cumin, and salt. Cook, stirring often, until tomatoes have broken down and thickened, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in cilantro.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Frijoles Rojos: Place beans in a medium bowl; add water to cover by at least 2 inches. Cover and let stand overnight at room temperature.</li>
        <li>Drain beans. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over medium-low. Add pork belly; cook, stirring occasionally, until browned, about 8 minutes. Stir in beans, broth, Hogao, cumin, and salt. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until beans are tender, 4 hours and 30 minutes to 5 hours, adding water, 1 cup at a time, if mixture becomes too thick.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Carne Molida: Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high. Add beef; cook, stirring to break into pieces, until browned, 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in Hogao, salt, and cumin; cook, stirring often, until well combined and heated through, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Chorizo: Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook chorizo links, turning occasionally, until lightly charred and cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Arepas: Combine masarepa, cheese, water, salt, and 1 tablespoon of the oil in a medium bowl. Stir with a wooden spoon until dough is smooth. (Dough will look soupy, but will firm up after standing.) Cover and let stand 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Shape dough into 4 (4-ounce) balls. Gently flatten each into a 1/2-inch-thick disk (about 3 1/2 inches in diameter). Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium. Cook arepas until golden brown and charred in spots, about 5 minutes per side.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Tajadas de Plátano: Cut plantains diagonally into 1/2-inch-thick slices. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook plantains, in batches, until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, and sprinkle with salt.</li>
        <li>Prepare the Huevos Fritos: Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Break eggs into pan, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook until whites are set and starting to brown around edges, 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Evenly divide Chicharrones, Frijoles Rojos, Carne Molida, Chorizo, Arepas, Tajadas de Plátano, Huevos Fritos, rice, avocados, and remaining Hogao among 4 platters. Garnish with cilantro, and serve immediately.</li>
